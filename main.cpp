//Step 1: You will first write DES code that will take as input a 
//64-bit plaintext block and a 64-bit key block (note that only 56 bits of those will be selected by PC-1, 
//since every 8th bit represents odd-parity) and produce as output a 64-bit ciphertext block.

//Step 2: You will use your implementation to explore the Avalanche effect of the original DES denoted as 
//DES0, as well as DES1, DES2, and DES3, where in each version an operation is missing in each round as follows:  
    //0. DES0 - the original version of DES. 
    //1. DES1 ‚Äì XOR with a round key is missing from F function in all rounds. 
    //2. DES2 ‚Äì S-boxes are missing from F function in all rounds; instead, inverse ùê∏ùê∏‚àí1of the Expansion 
    //Permutation E is used for contraction from 48 bits down to 32 bits. 
    //3. DES3 ‚Äì Permutation P is missing from F function in all rounds
